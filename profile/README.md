# Matcing open science projects with skilled contributors!

## Overview
We've created a platform that bridges researchers and engineers with open-source science projects using the power of vector search and ai technology. With over 500 real open-science projects already seeded in the platform, our platform is ready to solve the issue of effeciently matching skilled contributers with open source science.

## Project Details
Our platform uses ai technology to bridge skilled contributors to open source science projects.
Kakehashi has 2 main features.

### For skilled contributors:
When you register with ORCID, we extract data from your public records to create a user vector in our database. Using ai and vector search, we are able to match projects and generate personalized skill tags.
KAKEHASHI recommends projects tailored to your expertise based on your public records.
For project owners/leaders:

### We extract project information directly from existing project webpages.
Browse potential contributors suited for your project with a variety of ai-powered query features.
Contact potential contributors directly through the platform with just a click.
In this project we utilize NLP, LLMs, and Vector Search technology.


On our platform, users don't need to manually update their profiles because we've integrated OpenID Connect to automatically sync their information. Moreover, by simply providing a project's webpage, we can extract data and specify the skills required for that project.
